Chewy Chocolate Cherry Cookies
Need a new recipe to add to your holiday cookie mix? Here’s one that offers something different from the traditional peppermint or gingerbread flavors popular this time of the year. Chocolate lovers will enjoy these seriously fudgy cookies studded with tart-sweet dried cherries. Semisweet chocolate chips work best here, rounding out the cookie’s deeply chocolaty flavor.

Prep time: 15 minutes
Cook time: 12 minutes
Total Time: 27 minutes
Yield: 24 cookies
Ingredients
1 ½ sticks butter, melted and slightly cooled
½ cup Dutch-process cocoa powder (Hershey’s Special Dark works well)
½ cup granulated sugar
½ cup brown sugar, tightly packed
1 egg, room temperature
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
½ teaspoon salt
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
½ cup dried cherries
Directions
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix together the melted butter, cocoa powder, granulated sugar, brown sugar, vanilla extract, and egg until combined. If you don’t have a stand mixer, use a large bowl and a hand mixer or a large spoon.
Add the flour, baking powder, and salt to the bowl and mix until the dough comes together and no white streaks of flour remain. Scrape down the sides of the bowl to ensure you incorporate all ingredients. The dough will be slightly crumbly.
Add the chocolate chips and dried cherries and fold into the dough with a spatula.
Form tablespoon-sized balls of dough and place an inch apart on baking sheets lined with parchment paper. Press them down with your hand or the back of a spatula so they are about a half inch thick.
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes.
Let cool on baking sheets for about 5 minutes before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.
