It‚Äôs that time of year again, Terriers! As the weather gets colder and the holidays creep up, it‚Äôs only natural to begin your movie-binging. There‚Äôs nothing quite like snuggling up with loved ones and indulging in heartwarming films that capture the magic of the holidays. That said, it can be time-consuming to find a film everyone will agree on, so we asked the Terriers who follow @bostonu on Instagram do the picking for you. Here‚Äôs a list of the top five holiday classics our followers agreed on. 

1. Elf
This is a gif from the movie Elf. Elf is in the elevator with a stranger and he is pressing every single button and says "It looks like a Christmas tree." There is text at the bottom of the screen that reflects what he is saying. It is in a white, bold font.

It‚Äôs funny, heartwarming, and great for the whole family. Laughing is pretty standard when watching any Will Ferrell movie, no matter what age you are. The comedy follows Buddy, a human raised by elves at the North Pole, as he embarks on a journey to New York City to find his real father, Walter Hobbs. Buddy‚Äôs childlike innocence clashes with the bustling and cynical world of humans until he‚Äôs able to spread holiday cheer.

Rudolph, of course, is a holiday classic. The film is right up there with the animated Santa Claus and Frosty the Snowman movies everyone knows and loves from their childhood. The film is about one of Santa‚Äôs reindeers‚ÄîRudolph, whose luminous red nose sets him apart from his peers. Originally shamed and embarrassed by his unique feature, Rudolph discovers that his special ability becomes the key to guiding Santa‚Äôs sleigh on a foggy Christmas Eve. 

Available for purchase on Amazon Prime ($7.99)

3. Home Alone

Could this be a must-watch holiday movie list without Home Alone? This was Terriers‚Äô most loved holiday movie, winning by a landslide. In case you somehow haven‚Äôt watched it, the story follows a young boy who is accidentally left behind during his family‚Äôs vacation. While home, Kevin must defend the house against a duo of goofy burglars. It‚Äôs an original comedy classic!

Available for streaming on Disney+ & Hulu (free with Premium subscription)

4. Love Actually

This film follows the lives of eight very different couples dealing with their love life in various loosely interrelated tales, all set during a frantic month before Christmas in London.

The overriding message? The holidays are better when you spend them with the people who care about you, and that‚Äôs good enough for us.

5. The Polar Express

The train conductor, played by Tom Hanks, spoke one of the most iconic lines in holiday film history: ‚ÄúSeeing is believing, but sometimes the most real things in the world are the things we can‚Äôt see.‚Äù
